#Auction House Example Application for Axon#

This project is dedicated to the development of a full-fledged "Auction House" example application with the Axon Framework.

## Goals ##

* Domain Driven Design (DDD)
* Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) with the Axon Framework
* Easy enough to understand
* Big enough to have a full-flavored domain model
* Clear separation of concerns (Command Server, Query Server ...)
* Clear layer separation (No domain objects on clients...)
* Anyone interested can participate
* Website with live demo
* Use cases from Oracle/Sun's Auction House Tutorial
